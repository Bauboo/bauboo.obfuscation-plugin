# Obfuscation Plugin

Obfuscate emails and phone numbers for spammers, but not for your human visitors.

## How to Use it

Simply add the respective component onto your page and in specify the email address or phone number in the component's settings. The plugin will then automatically present bots with obscurified data, but humans receive a nicely formatted link.

## Why Should I Bother

Spammers try to crawl to internet for email addresses to send spam to. This is why you sometimes see emails written like 'mail(at)example.com'. This improves your resilience against spammers, but it is also annoying for regular, human users. This plugin solves this problem, by transforming to human readable and even linked formats as soon as we are reasonably sure that a visitor is human.

## Credits

This plugin uses a modified version of the [SpamSpan](https://www.spamspan.com/) script to unobscurify emails.
